# PythonChallenges
This repository is for the python challenges that we will be doing as a team at the company.  I will try my best to document everything that I have so that others can replicate and leverage it.  

If you find yourself looking through this repository out of curiousity, feel free to dive into any of them, and share your unique solutions to the problems.  Do note, that each of these will be sourced from the internet, whether it is via the Tableau Preppin Challenges https://preppindata.blogspot.com/p/the-challenge-index.html, or via other alternatives.
